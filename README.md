## Devlog
Write your Devlog here.
I think scenes, game objects and components are like the various parts of an outdoor adventure. Scenes are like the entire adventure area, such like a big mountain, where everything happens. Game objects are the things placed in that world, like players, coins and spikes(traps). Components are like the hidden traits or abilities that make these objects work: spiked traps can hurt you because they have colliders, coins can be collected because they have scripts, and players can move because they have controllers. They are interlinked. Components make the overall picture more vivid, and game objects make the scene rich and playable. They create a lively and interactive world together.
